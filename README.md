# Parallax Website

This project showcases a **Parallax Website**, which uses the parallax scrolling effect to create an interactive and visually engaging experience. The effect causes background elements to move at a different speed than the foreground elements as the user scrolls down the page, creating a dynamic, immersive experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on devices of all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Visual Storytelling**: Aimed at presenting content in an engaging and dynamic manner, perfect for portfolios, product showcases, or creative websites.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling, including positioning and the parallax effect.
- **JavaScript** (optional): For smooth scrolling and additional interactivity (if applicable).
